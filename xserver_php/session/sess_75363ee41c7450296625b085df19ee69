My name is Elliot and, contrary to many emails you could get, I would like to alternatively provide you with a word of kudos – Kudos!

What for?

A portion of my job is to review websites and the work you’ve done with chahokan.com definitely stands out. 

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a genuine investment of effort into making it superior.

Nonetheless, there is, however, a catch… more accurately, a question…

So, when someone such as me happens to find your site – perhaps at the top of the search results (nice job by the way) or just through a random link, how do you find out?

More importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Studies indicate that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one second and then gone with the wind.

There’s a way to create PROMPT engagement that you may not have known about…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s operates on your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number. It allows you know IMMEDIATELY that they’re interested – so that you can speak to that lead while they’re literally checking out chahokan.com.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works.

It could be a revolutionary change for your business – and it gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly (and there’s actually a 100X difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Moreover then, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can reconnect later on with text messages for new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to develop a relationship.

Each aspect I’ve just described is easy, user-friendly, and effective.
